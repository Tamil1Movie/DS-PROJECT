Here are the implementation steps for this social media friend recommendation system:

Step 1: Define Data Structures

	1.	Define FriendNode structure: This structure represents a node in the friend list of each user. It has two members:
	•	user_id: stores the ID of a friend.
	•	next: a pointer to the next friend in the list.
	2.	Define user structure: This structure represents each user in the network. It has two members:
	•	user_id: stores the unique ID of the user.
	•	friend_list: a pointer to the linked list of friends (of type FriendNode).
	3.	Create network array: Define a fixed-size array network to store pointers to user structures, representing the entire social network. Also, define an integer user_count to keep track of the number of users added.

Step 2: Implement createFriend Function

	1.	Create a friend node: Define the createFriend function, which takes a user_id as a parameter and allocates memory for a new FriendNode.
	2.	Initialize friend node: Set the user_id of the new node and set next to NULL.
	3.	Return node: Return the pointer to this new FriendNode.

Step 3: Implement addUser Function

	1.	Check for existing user: Iterate over the network array to check if the user with user_id is already in the network. If found, print a message and exit the function.
	2.	Add new user: If the user doesn’t exist, allocate memory for a new user structure, set its user_id, and initialize its friend_list to NULL.
	3.	Store in network: Add the new user to the network array at the current index of user_count.
	4.	Update and notify: Increment user_count and print a message that the user has been added.

Step 4: Implement displayNetwork Function

	1.	Display user list: Iterate over the network array, printing each user’s user_id to display all users in the network.

Step 5: Implement main Function

	1.	Menu display: Implement a loop to display a menu to the user with three options: add a user, display the network, or exit.
	2.	Read user choice: Use scanf to take the user’s choice and process it with a switch statement:
	•	Case 1: Calls addUser to add a user to the network.
	•	Case 2: Calls displayNetwork to list all users in the network.
	•	Case 3: Exits the program by returning 0.
	•	Default: Prints “INVALID CHOICE” if the choice is not in the menu.
	3.	Loop condition: Keep looping until the user selects “Exit.”

This structured approach ensures the friend recommendation system has basic functionality for adding users and displaying the current network.
